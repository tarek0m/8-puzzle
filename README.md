# 8-Puzzle Solver

## Description
This project is a GUI-based 8-puzzle game that allows the user to shuffle the puzzle and try to solve it by hand. Additionally, the program provides four algorithms for the computer to solve the puzzle automatically: Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), Euclidean A*, and Manhattan A*.
This project was developed as a class project for an AI course in term 5, Computer and Communication Department, Faculty of Engineering, Alexandria University.

## Features
- Shuffle the puzzle and solve it manually
- Automatic solving using BFS, DFS, Euclidean A*, and Manhattan A* algorithms
- Calculation of cost of the path, expanded nodes, search depth, and running time for each algorithm
- Option to track the solution movement step by step or animated

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/tarek0m/8-puzzle.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd 8-puzzle`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
1. Run the main script: `python main.py`
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the GUI and solve the puzzle.
